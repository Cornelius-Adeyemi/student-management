Database and sql questions


Question 1

If we have employees A, B, and C whose salaries are $100, $80, and $100 respectively, note that the second highest salary
is $80 although there are two employees with a higher salary.

SELECT DISTINCT(salary) FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1 ;(not correct)

SELECT MAX(salary) FROM emp WHERE salary < (SELECT MAX(salary) FROM emp);(not correct)

SELECT salary FROM (SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 2) AS emp ORDER BY salary LIMIT 1;(not correct)

SELECT DISTINCT salary FROM (SELECT salary FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 2) AS emp ORDER BY salary LIMIT 1;(not correct)

SELECT salary FROM emp ORDER BY salary DESC OFFSET 1 LIMIT 1;(not correct)


Question 2

This is the query

select country from city  c join games g on c.name = g.city;

Question 3

Left and right join is almost thesame.

left join means pick everything from the left table and join with the right table but only join the rows on the right table
that has same value on the column they are both joined.

from the table below

table 1

games                             city

yr     city               name        country

2004   Athens            Sydney        Australia
2008   Beijing           Athens        Greece
2012   London            Beijing       China
2032                      london       UK

left join query

Select * from games g left join city c on g.city = c.name;

result

 id      yr     city   name       country

 1     2004    Athens  Athens     Greece
 2    2008    Beijing  beijing    China
 3     2012    london  london    uk
 4    2032      null     null     null


 right join

 this is the opposite of left

 query

 Select * from games g right join city c on g.city = c.name;

 result

  id      yr     city   name       country

  1     null    null  sydney     Austrialia
  2    2004    Athens  Athens    greece
  3     2008    beijing  beijing    china
  4    2012      london     london     uk
